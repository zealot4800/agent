### Independent Auditor’s Review Report on Standalone unaudited financial results of Rishabh Instruments
Limited for the quarter pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended.

To The Board of Directors of Rishabh Instruments Limited

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of standalone unaudited financial results of Rishabh Instruments Limited (referred to as 'the Company') for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 ('the Statement'). This document is attached herewith and is being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended ('the Regulations').

This statement, prepared by the Company's Management and approved by the Company's Board of Directors, follows the recognition and measurement principles outlined in Indian Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting.' This standard is prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and is read with relevant rules issued thereunder, known as 'Ind AS 34.' It also adheres to other recognized accounting principles generally accepted in India and complies with the Regulations. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the statement based on our review.

### Review Methodology

We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, titled "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity," issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

A review of interim financial information involves:

- Making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters.
- Applying analytical and other review procedures.

This review is substantially less comprehensive than an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Consequently, it does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Therefore, we do not express an audit opinion.

Based on our review, as described in paragraph 3, nothing has come to our attention that leads us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles outlined in Ind AS 34 and other generally accepted accounting principles in India, has failed to disclose the required information as per the Regulations. This includes the manner of disclosure, and we have found no material misstatements.

### Review Conclusion

Based on our review and the procedures performed, as mentioned in paragraph 3, and considering the review reports of other auditors referred to in paragraph 6, we have found no issues. There is nothing that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS 34 and other generally accepted accounting principles in India, has failed to disclose the required information as per the Regulations. Furthermore, the manner of disclosure is appropriate, and there are no material misstatements.

We did not review the interim financial results of five subsidiaries included in the Statement. These subsidiaries' interim financial results reflect:

- Total revenues of Rs. 191.03 million
- Total net profit after tax of Rs. 11.18 million
- Total comprehensive income of Rs. 101.84 million

These figures are for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, as considered in the Statement. The interim financial results have been reviewed by other auditors, whose reports have been provided to us by the management. Our conclusion, regarding the amounts and disclosures related to these subsidiaries, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors and the procedures we performed as stated in paragraph 3 above. Our conclusion is not modified concerning our reliance on the work and reports of the other auditors.

The reporting structure has been revised to present the Group's geographical segments under a single segment, "Europe," effective from April 1, 2025. The "USA" segment has been combined and presented under "Other" in line with internal objectives. The "Poland" geography has been restated accordingly.

The Group has considered the implementation of a wholly-owned subsidiary, EURO 13,48,837, to extend its product portfolio in the field of industrial automation. This involves the acquisition of MICROSYS, spol. s.r.o, a company engaged in the production of the Promotic visualization system (SCADA). The acquisition of Lumel S.A. Sp. Z.0.0 was made through a share purchase agreement dated August 6, 2024, resulting in the acquisition of a 100% stake in MICROSYS, spol. s.r.o.

The management has completed the Purchase Price Allocation as per paragraph 45 of IND AS 103 "Business Combination." This includes the restatement of assets and liabilities, including intangibles and resultant goodwill, within twelve months from the date of acquisition. The provisional amounts were reported previously for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, and have been restated for the year ended June 30, 2025.
